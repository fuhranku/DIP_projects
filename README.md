## Technologies
- OpenGL 3.0
- ImGui UI builder
- OpenCV 4.4.0

## About the project
Graphic interface built from scratch with Vanilla C++, OpenGL and ImGui. For almost all Image processing techniques we used OpenCV functions. Some were build from zero as well. For more information about how to use the app check our inbuilt tooltip and help item.

## How to install

- Clone the project
- Download OpenCV ( version 4.4.0 ) from: https://opencv.org/releases/
- Install OpenCV
- Copy the file opencv_world440d.dll inside folder: opencv/build/x64/vc15/bin
- Paste the file inside project folder: src/x64/debug/
